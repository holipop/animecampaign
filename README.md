# Epithet/Anime Campaign System for Foundry VTT

This is an unofficial, fan-made implementation of the JelloApocolypse's Epithet/Anime Campaign System for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, developed by Sunny Holiday (Holipop).

Designed to be a port of the same system for Roll20, this system should feel familiar to any veteran player. Quality of life additions like custom character sheet categories, custom stats, and collapsible message text will streamline your game and allow you to make any kind character you want, simple or complex.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or issues, please message me on Discord! **@holipop**
